# Sneezer

The idea behind this project is to play around with Deezer API. More information will follow as the project takes shape.

For now, users may search Deezer music library for songs, albums and artists. Users may also play 30sec song previews, full songs will be available once authentication is implemented.

Note: While running the app on localhost, to aviod CORS error, you will need to request temporary access to the demo CORS Anywhere server on this [link](http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo).
